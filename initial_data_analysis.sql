/*  Narcoleptic Sleep Data Analysis by Jacqueline Chambers
    - Data collection started April 2014 for general health and sleep tracking.
    - Switched to a better app in October 2018 for sleep tracking.
    - Data analysis started September 2024 for project portfolio.

    Description: Sleep data was exported from the sleep tracking app and imported to a local MySQL DB
    for cleaning and prep (see prepped_sleep_data.sql). Health data was exported from the app and imported to
    Excel for cleaning and prep (see health_data_prep_summary.md), then to the same DB for final prep (see prepped_health_data.sql). 
    Initial analysis begins below. */

changes from 6am to 7am? What do these naps look like?
- 47 potential naps
- These entries look more like naps. Sometimes naps happened after teaching a 6:00am fitness class.
	* The record with 4.9 Hours_Recorded on 2024-06-12 looks weird. I checked it against my calendar and it looks like
